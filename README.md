### Project Description: Solving Linear Programming (LP) Problems Using Python

In this project, we aim to solve various **Linear Programming (LP)** problems that focus on optimizing resources under given constraints. These problems can be divided into two broad categories: **Maximization** (e.g., maximizing profit, revenue, etc.) and **Minimization** (e.g., minimizing cost, resources, etc.).

#### Objective of the LP Problems

The objective of each linear programming problem is to optimize (maximize or minimize) a certain objective function, subject to a set of constraints. The constraints define the feasible region, and the optimal solution lies at one of the corner points (vertices) of this feasible region. 

For example, in the **Maximizing Profit for a Factory** problem, the objective is to maximize the total profit by deciding how many units of two products to produce, considering the available machine time and raw materials. Each problem has:
- **Decision Variables**: These represent what is being optimized (e.g., the number of products produced).
- **Objective Function**: This defines the goal of the problem (e.g., maximizing profit or minimizing cost).
- **Constraints**: These are the limitations or restrictions (e.g., available labor, materials, machine time).

The key challenges of these problems are to find the feasible region (which satisfies all constraints) and then identify the optimal solution that maximizes or minimizes the objective.

### How the Problems Were Solved

The problems are solved graphically and computationally in Python using the following approach:

1. **Formulation**:
   - Define the **decision variables** (e.g., number of products).
   - Write the **objective function** (e.g., profit or cost) to maximize or minimize.
   - Write the **constraints** (e.g., machine hours, material availability).

2. **Graphical Method** (for 2-variable problems):
   - Plot the **constraints** as lines or inequalities on a graph.
   - **Shade the feasible region** where all constraints are satisfied.
   - Identify the **corner points** (vertices) of the feasible region.
   - **Evaluate the objective function** at each corner point to determine the maximum or minimum value.

3. **Python Libraries Used**:
   - **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting the constraints and feasible region.
   - **NumPy**: Used for efficient handling of numerical data and creating the constraint lines.
   - **SciPy/Linear Programming (Pulp)**: While for graphical solutions, constraints and objectives are evaluated manually, you could also use these libraries for automated LP solvers.

### Step-by-Step Python Code Execution

1. **Defining Constraints**: For each problem, we first define the mathematical constraints based on the problemâ€™s description. These constraints are typically linear equations or inequalities.

2. **Plotting the Constraints**: Using **Matplotlib**, we plot each constraint as a line, and shade the feasible region where all constraints are satisfied. This allows us to visually see the solution space.

3. **Finding Corner Points**: The feasible region is formed by the intersections of the constraint lines. These intersections are the **corner points** of the feasible region.

4. **Evaluating the Objective Function**: We evaluate the objective function at each corner point. The point that gives the optimal value (either maximum or minimum) is the solution.

5. **Optimizing**: The objective is either maximized or minimized based on the problem. For maximization problems, we select the corner point that gives the highest objective value. For minimization problems, we select the one that gives the lowest value.

### Example Problem: **Maximizing Profit for a Factory**

In this problem, the objective is to maximize the total profit from producing two types of products, given the constraints of machine time and raw material. 

1. **Objective Function**: 
   - Profit = \( 3 \times A + 4 \times B \) (Where A and B are the number of units produced of product A and B).
   
2. **Constraints**: 
   - Machine time: \( 2A + 3B \leq 12 \)
   - Raw material: \( A + 2B \leq 8 \)
   - Non-negativity: \( A \geq 0, B \geq 0 \)

3. **Solution Process**:
   - The constraints are plotted, the feasible region is shaded, and the objective function is evaluated at each corner point of the feasible region. 
   - The solution is found by selecting the point that maximizes the profit.

### How to Run the Python Code

Follow these steps to run the Python code and solve the LP problems:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Install Python and necessary libraries (Matplotlib, NumPy).
   - You can install these libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install matplotlib numpy
     ```

2. **Create a Python Script or Use Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open your preferred Python environment (Jupyter Notebook is recommended for easy visualization).

3. **Copy the Code**:
   - Copy the code provided for the respective problem into your script or Jupyter Notebook.

4. **Run the Code**:
   - Run the Python script or the Jupyter Notebook cells. This will generate the graphical plots of the feasible regions and calculate the optimal solution.

5. **Interpret the Results**:
   - The code will display the plot showing the constraints and the shaded feasible region. It will also print the corner points and the optimal solution.

6. **For Other Problems**:
   - You can modify the code by changing the decision variables, objective function, and constraints to fit other LP problems from the list.

### Example Output

For a maximization problem, after running the code, you might see:

```
Corner Points: [(0, 0), (0, 2), (4, 0)]
Objective Function Values: [0, 8, 12]
Optimal Solution: x1 = 4, x2 = 0, Maximum Revenue = 12
```

This means that to maximize the profit, the optimal solution is to produce 4 units of product A and 0 units of product B, yielding a maximum profit of 12.
